# paw-patrol
A Paw Patrol soundboard based off the 30 Day JavaScript Drum Kit project. 
This is mostly just a passion project, as my daughter really loves Paw Patrol.

I will likely make the page include Ryder sometime in the future and correct a bug with mouse clicks not restarting the audio. 
Right now, the web app "works" and I am working on a few other things.
